= Operators

== Introduction

During installation, you have the option to include various Operators as part of the deployment process.  Deployment of Operators is something that is second nature for those familiar with Openshift, however, for many of the customers coming from other Virtualization Platforms this concept is new.  Due to this reason, many times we choose not to install the Operators at Deployment Time.

For your lab environment, these will be pre-installed in an effort to save time, however, this section will cover the Operators that we typically install and configure as part of the Proof of Concept delivery and how they are typically configured.
