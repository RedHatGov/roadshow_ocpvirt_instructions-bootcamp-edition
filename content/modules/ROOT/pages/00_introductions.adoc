== OCP and Virt
** Why switch from a traditional VM platform?
Adopt cloud-native development and/or cloud-native operations: Red Hat OpenShift helps your team build applications with speed, agility, confidence, and choice. Code in production mode, anywhere you choose to build. Get back to doing work that matters.

** Complete app dev stack: Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces (formerly Red Hat CodeReady Workspaces), Runtimes, Integration and Process Automation, Serverless, Pipelines, and more with security throughout.

** Shift infrastructure spend to innovation: OpenShift native architecture changes the heavyweight cost structure from SDDC legacy to lightweight container-native frameworks.

** Risk mitigation: With OpenShift support for on-premises and public cloud options, OpenShift is insurance against public cloud lock-in.

** Independent from infrastructure: Red Hat OpenShift runs consistently on bare metal, on-premises virtualization, or public cloud for ultimate choice and flexibility of deployment and updates.

** Pure open source innovation: The innovation in Kubernetes, serverless, service mesh, Kubernetes Operators, and more powered by the velocity of open source, with Red Hat in the lead.
